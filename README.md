# Password Validator

Based on the requirements of the Advent of Code 2020 - day 2, a password validator has been developed. Based on password data from a .txt file, it calculates the number of valid passwords in the file comply to a set of rules, given on each line in the file before each password. 

To run the script, clone this repo and use node as follows,

```bash
$ node passwordValidatorOTCAS.js
```

In order to change the passwords or their requirements, open the .txt file and implement the desired changes.
